/*
    Note -> synchronised work on same object,
    where when we have multi object try to access same code then we use LOCK.

    ReentrantLock is a class in java.util.concurrent.locks that provides an explicit
    locking mechanism â€” similar to synchronise, but with more flexibility and control.

    It is called reentrant because a thread that already holds the lock can acquire
    it again without getting blocked.
